								<span>The digital economy is maturing and blockchain
								technology is changing the way we do business.
								The financial sector is leading the way in
								blockchain and digital assets. While some
								potential uses of blockchain technology may be
								years away, the digital economy is already here.
								The industry needs a bridge between traditional
								and emerging asset classes. Experienced
								traders have teamed up with experienced
								developers to build this bridge.</span>
								<span class="ga-space-first">Designed for mainstream adoption, the
								CoinMetro platform will be an all-in-one solution
								for crypto geared towards maximizing client
								value. We will deliver a rock-solid, user-focused
								framework that offers unparalleled mobility
								between blockchain-based digital assets and
								traditional markets.</span>
								<span>The CoinMetro Ecosystem will include (i) a fast,
								intuitive exchange, (ii) a feature-rich trading
								platform offering unique digital asset
								investment opportunities, and (iii) a turnkey ICO
								Express solution. All services will be accessible
								via a streamlined web application with a
								stunning UI, fully integrated with
								industry-leading blockchain platforms.
								CoinMetro will price all services using our own
								digital ERC20 utility token, called COIN.</span>
								<span>It is our vision that newcomers to the digital
								economy will be able to get started with buying
								their first Bitcoin instantly through our simple,
								supportive platform. Professional traders will
								enjoy a fast, secure, and highly flexible
								environment that integrates familiar features
								into our digital asset ecosystem. CoinMetro will
								also offer innovative investment models, such as
								our Tokenized Asset Management (TAM)
								platform and an Exchange-Traded Crypto Fund
								(ETCF) intended to give users access to one-click
								digital asset diversification options.</span>
								<h3>CoinMetro’s partners and Token Buyback Program</h3>
								<span class="ga-space-second">Integral to CoinMetro is the relationship to our
								strategic partner, FXPIG, an established Forex
								(“FX”) broker. FXPIG’s proven track record and
								experience in providing financial services will
								help CoinMetro to deliver its planned “Token
								Buyback Program.” The Token Buyback
								Program is one of the ways CoinMetro will look
								to initially stabilize the price of COIN and
								support market growth (See Section 4.0.4 for
								more information). Sharing of technology and
								human resources between CoinMetro and
								FXPIG will allow the CoinMetro Exchange to
								offer features, opportunities, and token sale
								bonuses above and beyond the scope of many
								current platforms.</span>

							<h4>Registration, Licensing, and Regulations (Multiple Jurisdictions)</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<div class="ga-text">
								<span>Hileman &#038; Rauchs emphasize that the biggest challenges faced by current
								cryptocurrency exchanges are maintaining relationships with payment
								gateways, banks, and traditional financial institutions. Based on an analysis
								of non-public data from over 150 companies in the cryptocurrency space,
								their study notes, “Small exchanges seem to have considerable difficulties
								with either obtaining or maintaining banking relationships&#8230;”5 Immediately
								upon launch of the CoinMetro Exchange, CoinMetro intends to operate as a
								registered eMoney Institution.</span>
								<span>Running a multi-faceted fintech platform means that we will require
								multiple licenses in multiple jurisdictions to remain compliant with regards
								to the services we plan to provide. The CoinMetro Token Sale will be based in
								Hong Kong, and compliant with the regulatory environment there. Moving
								forward, CoinMetro intends to provide services in jurisdictions
								where it is licensed, or where no license is required. During 2018, CoinMetro
								intends to apply for licenses in several jurisdictions that cover the full range
								of planned services.</span>
								<span>As of November 25th, 2017, CoinMetro is in the process of obtaining an
								eMoney license in Georgia and an Alternative Payment (And Crypto
								Exchange) License in Estonia. Our intention for the eMoney license is that it
								will enable operation of the payment services side of our business, dealing in
								fiat transactions with countries outside the European Union, where
								applicable by law. The Estonia license will allow us to operate our exchange,
								dealing in both fiatand crypto, serving clients both within the EU and
								worldwide, subject to applicable law, and accept payments via multiple
								gateways, including SEPA transfers, SWIFT transfers, credit cards, and
								external wallet systems, from residents of the European Union.</span>
								<span>We are also currently in talks to begin the process of acquiring an SIB Fund
								Management license in the Cayman Islands. This license would cover our
								ETCF and possibly our TAM platforms, and allow us to offer these services to a
								wide range of countries around the world, subject to the laws of each applicable jurisdiction.
								We will look to acquire additional licenses in order to expand our regulatory
								footprint and remain compliant as CoinMetro grows, and as new regulations
								come to light around the world.</span>

								<h2>CoinMetro Ecosystem</h2>
								<div class="ga-small">Summary</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<div class="ga-text">
									<span>Featuring a simple interface designed for mainstream adoption, the CoinMetro platform plans to serve as a conduit between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. CoinMetro’s multifaceted ecosystem will streamline three major components of the digital economy, offering: (i) an exchange, (ii) a trading platform, and (iii) a complete ICO Express framework.</span>
									<h4>Competitive Advantage</h4>
									<span>Working in tandem with FXPIG, CoinMetro plans to offer a wide range of services previously unavailable from a single entity. For new users entering the cryptocurrency space, two essential features are simplicity and the ability to purchase digital assets with fiat. Coinbase/GDAX is a clear testament to this, reportedly adding over 100,000 new users per day during peak times in late 2017.1 Ranking in volume as the world’s second largest Bitcoin exchange2, Coinbase/GDAX is obviously an ambitious project to compete with. However, while Coinbase offers an intuitive user interface and easy fiat/crypto exchange, it supports a limited number of digital currencies and trading pairs, and its customer support has been widely criticized by users3. CoinMetro integrates fiat support and a user-friendly interface, but offers a much broader range of on-platform functionality (like GDAX and Coinbase in one place, and then some). Plus, we are making customer support a major priority. We believe we are well positioned to provide a competitive alternative to Coinbase and similar platforms in overlapping jurisdictions.</span>
									<span>In addition to appealing to new and casual users, our trading platform will be equipped with a robust tool-set designed to meet the needs of professional investors. CoinMetro will offer customizable charting and analytics, support for a range of order types, lending options, and margin trading, here more akin to platforms like Bitfinex and Poloniex, but with a much cleaner UI, no reliance on Tether, more reliable uptime, progressive regulatory footprint, and transparent company policies.</span>
									<span>Our in-house XCM token is conceptually similar to Binance’s BNB and KuCoin’s KCS, two projects which have seen significant growth and rapid adoption since going live. We believe this bodes well for the role of XCM, which offers similar benefits to users (reduced fees, etc.) and has further actionable use cases for features that are currently unavailable through those exchanges.</span>
									<span>We feel as though the combination of an easy-to-use UI, crypto/fiat support, and advanced trading features already makes CoinMetro very competitive in the exchange space. Beyond that, the introduction of our unique investment models (ETCF’s and TAM Accounts) and our turnkey ICO Express engine pushes CoinMetro beyond being “just an exchange” and solidifies our vision of being a one-stop, all-in-one platform for crypto.</span>
									<h4>Market Share</h4>
									<span>Based on a study of over 400 ICO’s conducted in 2017, ICO Watchlist found that over 50% were implemented using the Ethereum blockchain.1 As more projects begin to explore tokenization of assets and services, CoinMetro is positioned to emerge as a forerunner in this space. We plan to offer an interface for easy token issuance through our ICO Express platform, as well as bring liquidity to the ERC-20 space through our exchange and ETCF Platform.</span>
									<span>Looking at the future of digital assets, tokenization appears poised to open the doors to new markets for mainstream blockchain adoption. While we will naturally offer bitcoin and traditional crypto services, CoinMetro’s vision also includes building the infrastructure to support emerging tokenized asset markets, which we believe will represent a substantial market. As University of Oregon Finance professor Stephen McKeon wrote, “Financial economists have attempted to measure the illiquidity discount in a variety of ways. A common rule of thumb is 20–30%. This represents a huge amount of value and therein lies great promise. Tokenizing relatively illiquid assets and creating a market in which to trade these tokens can reduce the illiquidity discount substantially by reducing frictions to trade. Traditional assets will tokenize because they will lose the liquidity premium if they don’t.”</span>

									<h4 id="direct-payment-process">Direct Payment Process &#8211; Cryptocurrency and Fiat Support</h4>
									<span>Direct payment processing in fiat and cryptocurrencies will be possible through CoinMetro’s stable banking relationships fostered by its registered and licensed eMoney status in Georgia and Estonia which it is currently pursuing. This feature will be available to both direct CoinMetro clients and to third-party clients, such as companies running their own ICO through our easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure.</span>

									<h4 id="debit-card">CoinMetro Debit Card</h4>
									<span>To provide clients with instant access to their CoinMetro wallet balances, we plan to offer a
										CoinMetro debit card. We envision that clients will be able use the CoinMetro debit card to
										access their cryptocurrency wallets or fiat wallet and withdraw cash instantly at certain ATM
									locations worldwide. Having already implemented a successful debit card system for FXPIG, our team has a comprehensive understanding of the logistics of this space and we have developed a solution designed to provide maximum flexibility and utility to CoinMetro users. Clients may choose a default account for use with the card as well as a list of secondary accounts that can be debited in case the balance of the default account is insufficient to cover the requested transaction. When using the card at an ATM, the system will check the balance in the default account first. If a conversion is needed to the withdraw currency, an order will hit our matching engine to perform the conversion instantly, eliminating inconvenient delays in processing time. If the default account has insufficient funds, the secondary accounts will be debited.</span>

									<h4 id="risk-limatation">Risk Limitation</h4>
									<span>We propose that CoinMetro’s underlying risk management strategy will use designated
										margin wallets to mitigate damages and prevent losses when trading using borrowed
										margin on our give and take lending platform. Position losses will be covered by funds in a
										trader’s margin wallet, which serve solely as collateral. If the net value of a trader’s account
										falls below the required maintenance margin, their position will be forced into liquidation.
										To open a position, we propose that a trader will be initially required to allocate 30% margin
										based on the desired position size. Should the net value of the account fall below 15% of
									the value of the margin position, the account will be liquidated.</span>

									<h4 id="decentralization">Decentralization and Atomic Swaps</h4>
									<span>Generally, cryptocurrency exchanges are at least “semi-centralized,” given that assets are often
										held by the exchange on behalf of its client base. The move toward fully decentralized exchange mechanisms has begun, and CoinMetro plans to take a proactive approach to this technology. The CoinMetro team sees technology like <a href="#">Polkadot</a>, <a href="#">Cosmos</a>, and <a href="#">Aion</a> approaching, and understands that atomic swaps and cross chain communication will be extremely significant going forward.
									CoinMetro intends to offer atomic swap-like ‘peer-2-peer secure exchanges’ using time locked smart contracts where no third party intervention is needed to complete the transaction. The smart contract will act as a form of timed escrow, ensuring that both parties are protected in the event that one party defaults on the transaction. It is intended that this exchange mechanism will carry fees that will be almost zero from our side, as it will be considered an added service for clients who are trading smaller volumes and those that do not require immediate execution.</span>

									<h4 id="trading-gui">Trading GUI</h4>
									<span>The Matching Engine will allow clients to send both standard and non-standard order types,
										including: Markets, Limits, Stops, Limit Stop Orders and OCO (One Cancels Other) orders,
									which are a combination of Stop and Limit orders on the same ticket. The system will also allow for several different TIF (Time in Force) options, such as FOK (Fill or Kill), IOC (Immediate or Cancel), and GTC (Good till Cancelled).</span>

									<span>Charting will be powered by a professional grade HTML5 library that allows users to customize their layout with a few clients and add in multiple time and price studies or indicators with ease. Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, clients will be able place stop and limit orders based on
										pre-calculated risk to reward settings. To reduce latency for higher frequency traders and to
									simplify the order enter process one click trading will be available right from the chart. Historical trades, both filled and pending orders, can be plotted on the chart, as well, so the client will be able to see a graphical representation of their account activity.</span>
									<span>The platform is intended to be accessible from both a web browser and via our own
										CoinMetro-branded iOS and Android apps. API access and FIX 4.4 connectivity will be
									available. Following the approach of our strategic partner, FXPIG, API and FIX access will be open to anyone who requests it, with no minimum volume requirements or access fees.</span>

									<h4 id="lending">Lending</h4>
									<span>
									CoinMetro’s unique lending platform is intended to give passive investors an opportunity to earn interest on their cryptocurrency balances and create potential for under-capitalized traders to increase their profits. Our lending platform is envisaged to work by letting lenders state their daily rate on which they are prepared to lend; borrowers will be able to accept and immediately use the underlying assets as margin. CoinMetro plans to offer BTC, LTC, and ETH lending options.</span>

									<h4 id="exchange-fee-structure">Exchange Fee Structure (Bonus)</h4>
									<span class="ga-space-first">Our proposal intends that takers on the exchange, or clients who place orders that are filled immediately, will pay a commission on all executed orders, starting from a MAXIMUM of 0.10%. Makers onto the exchange, clients who place limit orders below the ticker price on the buy side, and above the ticker price on the sell side, will receive rebates that account for up to 50% of any fee charged to the taker that eventually hits their resting orders. If two makers’ orders are eventually matched (i.e. neither side is matched immediately) neither will be paid a rebate, but no commissions will be charged to either side.</span>
                                    <h4 id="cryptocurrency-wallet">Cryptocurrency Wallet &#8211; Supported Cryptocurrencies</h4>
									<span>CoinMetro’s cryptocurrency wallet system will allow clients to hold, deposit and withdraw in the five largest digital currencies by market capitalization (~80%):</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
										<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>
										<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
										<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
										<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
									</ul>
									<span>By partnering with BitGo, the industry leader in multi-signature, multi-currency wallets,
										CoinMetro plans to offer clients convenient and secure services through BitGo’s multi-signature
									technology.</span>
									<span>Following our initial launch, CoinMetro plans to incorporate support for additional wallet
									platforms, adding more and more assets over time. Immediately after launch we will look to add support for the complete list of top ten cryptocurrencies mentioned on Coin Market Cap (https://coinmarketcap.com), including Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), and BitCoin Gold (BTG). We will also look to add NEM (XEM) given that we will be developing tools based on the NEM blockchain. We plan to add additional assets over time, including ERC20 tokens, which will form the base for our EFTC platform (Section 3.3.2).</span>

									<h4 id="leverage">Leverage</h4>
									<span>Liquidity provider relationships, fostered by our strategic partner, FXPIG, allows us to offer
										clients access to 1:50 leverage when trading non-deliverable OTC digital assets, either via our
									browser based platform or through an API or FIX connectivity. Leverage on our matching engine will be capped at 1:10 initially when trading using borrowed margin by way of our give and take lending platform. Higher leverage will be made available to clients with a proven track record of low risk operations on a case by case basis. Via our partnership with FXPIG, CoinMetro intends to offer FIX and API access to our exchange by way of a Prime of Prime model where FXPIG is the margin/credit provider. This will give individual and institutional traders access to exchange grade liquidity, spreads, and execution quality, paired with CFD like available leverage.</span>

									<h4 id="ecosystem-growth">Ecosystem growth</h4>
									<span class="ga-space-second">We believe that giving people additional opportunities to earn by engaging with the platform will incentivize client participation, retention, and enthusiasm. It also ensures more liquidity within the engine, which keeps spreads low and generates higher overall volumes. We intend for users to be rewarded for participation in COIN, and for the scope of rewarded activities to grow and change as the platform develops. At release of the CoinMetro platform users will be rewarded for simply signing up to CoinMetro and creating a wallet, using the exchange for the first time, referring friends to the platform, and completing user feedback forms designed to help the team improve the platform.</span>

								<h4>Innovative Investment Platform</h4>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
									<span>Tokenized Asset Management (TAM) is a unique concept developed by the CoinMetro team. TAM will allow professional asset managers to sell tokens in their trading performance to investors. Each pro trader (or “manager”) will be issued a unique personal token valued in and available for purchase priced in COIN, a fully minted ERC20 token that is used to price all CoinMetro products and services. COIN is our own uniq ue digital asset created to facilitate interaction with our infrastructure and provide transparency to our client base by way of the Ethereum blockchain.</span>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
									<span>Through TAM, clients will be able to work with a manager of their choice by investing in that manager’s token. Similar to earning a commission, managers will profit from fees based on the high-water mark principle (i.e. the highest peak in value for a given account), and investors will 6 benefit based on the growth of their investment. With a few clicks, investors will be able to quickly move funds between manager-specific tokens, COIN, and other crypto or fiat assets. Blockchain-based tokenization will facilitate a secure and transparent process, where each trade can be linked back to specific investors and managers, giving users a complete overview of their digital assets at all times.</span>

									<h4 id="easy-dao-registration">Easy DAO Registration</h4>
									<span>CoinMetro’s ecosystem aims to allow projects to register and deploy their business as a specialized smart contract or Mosaic on the Ethereum, NEO or NEM blockchain. This will allow users to formalize their business transactions without the explicit need of a ‘paper corporation.’</span>

									<h4 id="quick-to-market">Quick to Market</h4>
									<span class="ga-space-first">Through our vetting process and token interface, the CoinMetro ecosystem aspires to foster innovation by giving projects the infrastructure and tools they need to raise funds, gain support, and launch atop a stable platform. Tokens issued through CoinMetro will be liquid and immediately tradable on the exchange following the token sale.</span>

									<h4 id="fiat-and-crypto-deposits">Fiat and Cryptocurrency Deposits</h4>
									<span>We envisage that CoinMetro’s planned infrastructure and banking relationships will enable fiat and cryptocurrency deposits on one platform. It is intended that users will be able to make deposits through a wide range of channels, including credit card, e-wallet, local bank deposit, SWIFT transfer, SEPA transfer, and multiple cryptocurrencies.</span>

									<h4 id="whitel-labeling">White Labeling Opportunities</h4>
									<span>CoinMetro proposes creating unique white-labelling opportunities for enterprise clients through our token sale platform. Clients will be able to white label our digital wallet and portal setup, allowing them to offer crypto and fiat payments to their own user-base and token sale participants. CoinMetro plans to allow token issuers to create and customize their own branded interface and backend while taking advantage of the tools, such as easy token issuance, provided by our larger ecosystem architecture. When initial token sales end, tokens will be immediately tradable on the main exchange, with the option to add the token to one or more of our curated ETCF baskets for additional liquidity.</span>

									<h4 id="smart-contracts">Smart Contracts</h4>
									<span>Smart contracts and digital tokens will be easily issuable on the ETH, NEO and NEM blockchains through the Coinmetro platform’s planned interface. As new blockchain innovations emerge, there is potential to integrate new features and platforms into CoinMetro’s ecosphere.</span>
									<span class="ga-space-second">Smart contracts provide users with automated, low-fee transactions that provide a higher level of security than those that rely on standard localized databases. To reduce latency all smart contracts related to live trading will be created or written post-trade. As blockchain technology becomes faster, we will explore the option to write all trade data in real time inside a distributed ledger. Smart contracts will manage approval workflows between counterparties and calculate trading settlement amounts with a level of accuracy not found in standard database technology.</span>

							<h4>User Interface</h4>
							<div class="ga-text">
								<span>Blockchain, as an underlying protocol, has the potential to radically transform the business landscape across many major industries. A developer-focused community is striving to advance the technology, while at the same time a lack of usability is widely recognized as a major barrier to entry into what is already possible within the blockchain space.</span>
								<span>A 2017 article from Coin Telegraph honed in on the crucial role of user experience in relation to building sustainable businesses in the blockchain space: “Creating user interfaces that can enable the easy application of Blockchain solutions without any special coding skills or extra computer language specialization appears to be an important aspect of industry development if Blockchain is to go mainstream.”[7] </span>
								<span>User experience is a core aspect of the vision for CoinMetro. We aim to provide a feature-rich platform that combines secure backend infrastructure with a highly intuitive front-end interface. Simple sign-up, instant access, direct payment processing, asset mobility, and unparalleled customer support are defining features of our vision for the platform.</span>
								<h4>Customer Support</h4>
								<span>CoinMetro intends to include a dedicated customer support center and thorough documentation for the purposes of ensuring that the platform is suited to users coming from all levels of experience. In addition to a 24/7 dedicated help desk, we plan to integrate a friendly, on-brand AI bot, “Frank”, designed to assist clients with troubleshooting, questions, and quick reference guides. CoinMetro’s customer support network plans to include a live-chat option via Intercom, an extended FAQ section, knowledge base, Slack channel, and supplemental videos to walk through important features.</span>

Since its establishment in 2011, FXPIG has maintained a firm commitment to customer security. As of the date of this whitepaper, the company has never been hacked, never lost a client’s funds, and remained virtually incident-free.</span>

								<h4>Two-factor Authentication (via Authy)</h4>
								<span>Two-factor authentication (“2FA”) adds an additional security layer to user accounts. Login and account access wil require both a password and a unique multi-digit code sent to a registered physical device, such as a phone. Authy’s multi-device 2FA feature gives users a convenient solution to securing their data.</span>

								<h4 id="web-application">Web Application</h4>
								<span>CoinMetro’s core user interface will be built using ReactJS. React is flexible and scalable, making it perfect for designing interactive UIs. To build a fully functional dynamic application, we will supplement ReactJS with Gulp to automate tasks and manage content and template changes. The combination of the two offers a powerful alternative to existing task-runners, allowing us to streamline our development workflow and optimize existing code.</span>
								<h4 id="rest-api">REST API</h4>
								<span class="ga-space-in">Our platform’s REST API will be developed using NodeJS, TypeScript and Express. With a keen awareness of best practices, CoinMetro’s REST architecture will emphasize performance, scalability and security while remaining highly flexible, simple, and stable.</span>
								<span>This layer is intended to provide a secure, reliable connection between the frontend interface and the CoinMetro database. The API will employ essential input validation to prevent cross-site request forgergy attacks and cross-site scription (XSS) or SQL breaches. We propose that main authorization will be performed using tokens in request headers with all the resource collections being processed in standalone units whenever possible. The API’s internal functionalities are envisaged to be quite complex; however, the external layer is planned to be been kept open and remain simple to work with. Access permissions will be restricted and closely monitored, with end users only able to gain access to specific portions of the full API workflow. Frequent onsite security audits are intended to ensure that the API is constantly evolving based on real world production level risk analysis.</span>
								<span>The CoinMetro API will be available to our partners, enabling them to build third-party services and applications that communicate with our core database.</span>
								<h4 id="database">Database</h4>
								<span>CoinMetro plans to use the open-source, document-oriented database program, MongoDB, to handle authentication, network isolation, and encryption. Fully elastic and natively “blockchain” structure supportive, Mongo is built to scale and is highly available by default. Role-based access controls enhance data security, while optimized dashboards highlight key historical metrics. MongoDB Atlas has been independently audited and confirmed to meet privacy and compliance standards.</span>
								<span class="ga-space-second">In addition to Mongo, CoinMetro will deploy PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source, fully ACID compliant object-relational database system. Backed by over 15 years of active development, PostgreSQL’s proven architecture has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and performance.</span>

							<h2>Long Term</h2>
							<h4>Stability of COIN</h4>
							<div class="ga-long-term-center"><span>Many ERC20 tokens focus on speculation rather than utility, which is not encouraged by CoinMetro. Long term value, for those tokens, starts at utility and also relies on supply and demand. In order to manage supply,  help reduce volatility and enable persons who need COIN to obtain them, CoinMetro has created a three-pronged approach as outlined here: </span>
							</div>
							<div class="ga-text-2">
								<span>The creation of a Token Buyback Reserve, funded with up to 20% of CoinMetro’s  and FXPIG’s net profits. CoinMetro intends to use the Token Buyback Reserve to support the stability of COIN on the CoinMetro exchange as needed. To facilitate liquidity on both buy and sell sides, COIN bought back by CoinMetro will be sold onto the exchange as needed depending on the underlying demand. NOTE: Net Profits here refers to net operating profits once CoinMetro is fully operational and does not in any way relate to the sums collected by way of the scheduled Pre-Token or Token Sales. Purchasers have no rights in respect of the Token Buyback Reserve and the use of the profits is at CoinMetro’s discretion and control.  It is also subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  </span>
								<span class="op">Gauging the possible size of this reserve is difficult at the outset of the initial Token Sale. On the FXPIG side, the numbers are easier to discern given its verifiable track record. On the CoinMetro side, projections are generally based on market size and capitalization, as well as speculation based on published data from competitors and general market research. In this light we anticipate year one focusing on establishing the brand and fostering its initial growth. Year two, we see gross margin somewhere in the area of 8 to 10 million EUR. Year three pushes this sum higher, to upwards of 18-22 million EUR. These figures would mean a total market penetration equalling approximately 1.25% for year two and 2.5% for year three, based on the current total volumes traded, which will increase over time.</span>
								<span class="op">It is planned that all fees payable to CoinMetro, either on our exchange, via our investment vehicles, such as the TAM and ETCF platforms, or for our ICO-related services via the ICO Express gateway, will be paid in COIN.</span>
								<span class="op">We expect that demand for COIN will rise with usage of CoinMetro’s service. Rising demand implies higher prices over time. Each time a fee is paid, whether it is priced in BTC, ETH, USD, or any other currency, an equivalent amount of COIN will be purchased on the exchange to cover said fees. Thus, the buy side on our exchange platform will be very active. In the event that no sell orders are present to support the needed conversions, resting COIN sell orders from CoinMetro’s liquidity reserve will be added to the book at a price equal to the indicative market value.</span>
								<span>In order to create a strong long term value proposition for COIN, we intend that 1%, 5%, 10% or 33% of each fee payment will be burned. As usage of the platform accelerates, the availability of the COIN token will diminish, thus decreasing supply and helping to maintain a competitive economic model for COIN.</span>
								<span>We intend that holders of COIN tokens will be offered discounts on fees based on their overall COIN holdings. The more COIN they own, the higher the discount will be. This will likely incentivize clients to buy and hold COIN, further reducing the available supply. NOTE &#8211; This is part and partial to the LIFETIME discounts offered to our pre-Token Sale and Token Sale contributors which are not based on their total individual contribution.</span>

								<h4>Bonus Structure for Pre-Token Sale and Token Sale Participants</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<div class="ga-text-3">
									<span>Pre-Token Sale contributors will be eligible for a bonus of up to 500%, based on the final COIN value, should we reach our 300,000,000 COIN hardcap during the pre-Token Sale/Token Sale event. NOTE &#8211; Although this discount is sizeable this is only for the first 2.5% of tokens sold, with the discount diminishing as more tokens are sold. The reality is that most larger token sale events offer substantial discounts to private investors prior to their public pre-sale events, so while this may appear excessive it is in fact commonplace with the difference here being that CoinMetro has decided to offer these ‘friends and family’ discounts to the community at large rather than to a small select group of private investors.</span>
									<span>CoinMetro and FXPIG intend to create a Token Buyback Reserve funded with up to 20% of the net revenues of both companies used to support the COIN price by adding liquidity when needed to bolster the market.</span>
									<span>See section 4.0.5 above for more information.</span>
									<span>Once 200 million COIN are sold during the Token Sale, participants will be granted lifetime discounts on applicable fees tied to services on both CoinMetro and FXPIG’s platforms.</span>
									<span>It is intended that Token Sale participants will be privy to private invitations and exclusive opportunities concerning all future Token Sales offered by any of CoinMetro’s founders, as well as special pricing on select Token Sales launched via our ICO Express Platform.</span>

									<span>For the CoinMetro platform to move forward into the operational stage, the Token Sale must reach its minimum sale target of EUR 3 million. In the event that the CoinMetro Token Sale fails to reach this minimum, COIN purchasers will be provided with the opportunity for a refund on the COIN purchased.</span>
									<span>In the event that the CoinMetro Token Sale reaches its goal without selling all available COIN, unsold COIN will be permanently eliminated and will not be circulated/sold.</span>
									<span>Token Sale participants should be aware that, as with any developing industry, there are risks involved (including the failure to build the intended platform). CoinMetro has worked hard to mitigate these risks by partnering with the industry-leading blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, NEO and NEM, globally recognized payment processors such as BitGo. The potential for future regulation, security vulnerabilities in one of our third-party service providers, volatility in cryptocurrency markets, and other circumstances may present unforeseen challenges that may impact the CoinMetro platform and/or the value of COIN.
